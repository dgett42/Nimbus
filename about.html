            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, I’m Donovan, I focus on creating digital spaces that not only look great but also deliver a seamless user experience on every device. My journey in web development began with a fascination for technology and a drive to help businesses build a strong online presence.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I’ve sharpened my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern website frameworks, turning ideas into fast, responsive, and secure websites. I enjoy blending design and code to solve real-world problems and give every project a polished, professional feel.</p>
            <p>I build websites that don’t just look good—they work hard for your business. I focus on creating clean, fast, and secure sites that make it easy for customers to find you, trust you, and take action.</p>
            <p>Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
